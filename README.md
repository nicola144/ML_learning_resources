Resources,cheat sheets to learn about machine learning

Hello World!

Here I will put pdf files, cheat sheets, anything I have found to be interesting and useful for anyone who wants to start learning about Machine Learning, which is a huge topic and one may get lost into the overwhelming amount of information on the internet. 
I will be updating this fairly frequently especially at the beginning. Feel free to make me suggestions.
Quite obviously I have not actually read/understoood 100% **everything** that I put here (*yet*).
Hopefully you will find some things useful, 

Nicola 

(P.S. : Guess why my profile picture is an optical illusion..)

Note : ALL the material is accessible online, no shaky things here.
