Resources,cheat sheets to learn about machine learning

Hello World!

Here I will put pdf files, cheat sheets, anything I have found to be interesting and useful for anyone who wants to start learning about Machine Learning, which is a huge topic and one may get lost into the overwhelming amount of information on the internet. I like getting the basics right so you will find a lot of linear algebra and probability revision (I have not found a resource that satisfies me for calculus, not that many really interesting things would be needed anyway). 
I will be updating this fairly frequently especially at the beginning. Feel free to make me suggestions.
Hopefully you will find some things useful, 

Nicola
