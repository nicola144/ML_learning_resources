Resources,cheat sheets to learn about machine learning

Hello World!

Here I will put pdf files, cheat sheets, anything I have found to be interesting and useful for anyone who wants to start learning about Machine Learning, which is a huge topic and one may get lost into the overwhelming amount of information on the internet. I like getting the basics right so you will find a lot of linear algebra and probability revision (I have not found a resource that satisfies me for calculus, not that many really interesting things would be needed anyway). Don't miss out on the matrix calculus pdf, probably one of the most useful things here. I plan to include both very academic/mathsy resources, but also more practical/applied/coder friendly ones.
I will be updating this fairly frequently especially at the beginning. Feel free to make me suggestions.
Hopefully you will find some things useful, 

Nicola 

Note : ALL the material is accessible online, no shaky things here.
